# freeCodeCamp_projects
This is a repository containing all the projects I did during freeCodeCamp web design certification.

In this ***Responsive Web Design Certification***, I learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

As a part of the certification I built the following projects:

- Build a Survey Form
- Buid a Tribute Page
- Build a Techical Documentation Page
- Build a Product Landing Page
- Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
