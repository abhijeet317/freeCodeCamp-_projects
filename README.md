# freeCodeCamp_projects
This is a repository containing all the projects I did during freeCodeCamp web design certification.

In this ***Responsive Web Design Certification***, I learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

As a part of the certification I built the following projects:

- [Build a Survey Form](https://github.com/abhijeet317/freeCodeCamp_projects/tree/main/Survey_Form)
- [Buid a Tribute Page](https://github.com/abhijeet317/freeCodeCamp_projects/tree/main/Tribute_Page)
- [Build a Techical Documentation Page](https://github.com/abhijeet317/freeCodeCamp_projects/tree/main/Technical_Documentation_Page)
- [Build a Product Landing Page](https://github.com/abhijeet317/freeCodeCamp_projects/tree/main/Product_Landing_Page)
- [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://github.com/abhijeet317/freeCodeCamp_projects/tree/main/Personal_Portfolio_Webpage)
